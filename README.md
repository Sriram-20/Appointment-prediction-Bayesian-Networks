# Appointment-prediction-Bayesian-Networks

A Bayesian network is a data structure that represents the dependencies among random variables. 

# Appointment

Here we are predicting the he/she can make an appointment on time or not. We are using 4 nodes to predict this there are Rain, Train, Maintenance, Appointment.

1. Rain has no parent.
2. Train has two parent (Rain, Maintenance).
3. Maintenance has one parent (Rain).
4. Appointment has one parent (Train).

# Equation

The equation to prediction the probability - P(Appointment, light, no) is equal to Î±[P(Appointment, light, no, delayed) + P(Appointment, light, no, on time)].

# Steps

1. First, we create the nodes and provide a probability distribution for each one.
2. We create the model by adding all the nodes and then describing which node is the parent of which other node by adding edges between them.
3. We want to predict what is the probability that there is no rain, no track maintenance, the train is on time, and we attend the meeting.
4. Otherwise, we could use the program to provide probability distributions for all variables given some observed evidence.
